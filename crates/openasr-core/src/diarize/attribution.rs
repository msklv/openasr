//! "Who said what" attribution — a pure interval function with zero model
//! coupling (plan §3.3).
//!
//! Each transcript segment is assigned the speaker whose turns overlap it the
//! most (WhisperX `assign_word_speakers` semantics). When a segment overlaps
//! turns from MULTIPLE distinct speakers and carries word timestamps, it is
//! split at speaker-turn boundaries snapped to word boundaries: each word goes
//! to the turn covering its midpoint, runs of same-speaker words become
//! separate segments, and the segment text is carved at the corresponding word
//! positions (no text is invented or lost). A single-stream ASR cannot emit
//! two simultaneous transcripts, so a word inside an overlap is linearized
//! from the nearest clean speaker context on both sides: a transition switches
//! at the overlap midpoint, while the same clean speaker on both sides keeps
//! ownership throughout. Without word anchors the text cannot be split
//! faithfully, so multi-speaker attribution fails closed instead of keeping a
//! single dominant-overlap speaker. The native pipeline first requests the
//! family's own word anchors and automatically invokes the shared forced
//! aligner when a coarse ASR segment still crosses speaker turns.
